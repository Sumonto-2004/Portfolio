    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>As a devoted student of BSc in Materials Science and Engineering at BUET, I am highly interested in exploring the properties and applications of material towards resolving real-life problems. My study background has provided me with a solid basis in materials characterisation, nanotechnology, and green material development.<br>Throughout my academic life, I have been involved in many research projects, including collaborating in the development of sodium batteries and studying better composite materials. Through these experiences, my analytical skills have been honed and strengthened, and my interest in innovative problem-solving in materials science has increased.<br>I am well-versed with MATLAB, SolidWorks, and other material characterisation methods. My vision is to make meaningful contributions to state-of-the-art research and development activities in the area of materials science with a specific focus on sustainable and energy-saving technologies.<br>Since the beginning of my student life, I have been optimistic and always dreamed of the best from myself. I was enthusiastic to learn new things. I am from Kalukhali, Rajbari. At a very young age, my parents shifted to Dhaka for working purposes. I completed my Secondary School Certificate from Rajendrapur Cantonment Public School & College and my Higher Secondary Certificate from Notre Dame College.<br>My first big success in class one was when I was a student of Savar Golden School, a small kindergarten school at Akrain Bazar, Savar. As the only student at the school, I received my first scholarship, a testament to my privilege. Afterwards, my family relocated to Rajendrapur due to work. My father, who worked as an engineer in BRAC, was appointed at BRAC CDM, Rajendrapur. I got admitted to Rajendrapur Cantonment Public School in the middle of the year, and with many remarkable memories, I completed my SSC from there.I then sat for the admission test of Notre Dame College, and by the mercy of the Almighty, the intercession of my parents and relatives, and my own hard work, I was admitted to NDC. The two years in NDC were the best of all. My life course changed there. I started competing with the best and finally came out with the topmost opportunity to study at BUET in Materials and Metallurgical Engineering.<br>Now, I also want to be successful in my career. I am a person who believes in pedagogical content knowledge—knowledge beyond the subject—and wants to be not only an effective professional but also a good human being. I want to contribute to others' success and dream of a world where everyone lives happily together.</p>

      <h3>3D Robotic Arm</h3>
      <h4>SolidWorks Project</h4>
      <p>This project features a 3D model of a robotic arm designed using SolidWorks. The design simulates a multi-joint robotic manipulator, similar to those used in manufacturing and automation industries. It is ideal for educational demonstrations, simulation tasks, and can serve as a foundation for further development in robotics.</p>
      <p>Features</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Fully articulated robotic arm with multiple degrees of freedom</li>
        <li>Modeled and assembled using SolidWorks 2021</li>
        <li>Designed with motion simulation capabilities</li>
        <li>Modular components for easy modification and scalability</li>
        <li>Custom end-effector attachment (can be replaced with tools such as grippers, pens, etc.)</li>
